		h1.page-title Getting Started

		article.article
			p Barebones is a SASS boilerplate to help you build your own front-end framework. It is not a fully-fledged library, but a set of commonly used tools; a grid system, helper classes and a range of mixins, put together in a convenient package to kickstart your next project. 

			//- Elements are stripped down to their icluding buttons, tables, typographic resets, bullet lists are included with minimal styling so you can spend less time overwriting and more time creating something that looks unique. 			

			p The best way to use Barebones is to download the source from <a href="https://github.com/sebpowell/barebones">Github</a> and start building!

			h2 Bower

			p You can also get the latest release using Bower, although this is somewhat against the philsophy behind this project (rather than include as a depenency, you should ideally use this as a foundational code-base).

			p If you decide to do this, you'll need to do the following:

			p 1. Install the Barebones package
			pre
				code.language-bash
					| bower install barebones

			p 2. Create a settings file (<a href="../build/settings.html">see here</a> for more info)

			p 3. Create a new SASS file, import the settings file first followed by _base.sass.
			pre
				code.language-scss
					| @import "_settings.scss"
					| @import "bower_components/dist/_base"

			h2 Requirements

			p Barebones relies heavily on SASS maps to work, so you'll need to make sure you're using SASS 3.3 or higher. Additionally, vendor prefixing mixins are not used or included as you can use the <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer" target="_blank">autoprefixer plugin</a> to do this.
