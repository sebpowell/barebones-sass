		h1.page-title Settings

		article.article

			p Barebones stores all project settings in a structured SASS map (_settings.scss). This map is a starting point – you can extend it any way you like. Default categories are included below (or <a href="https://github.com/sebpowell/barebones/blob/master/docs/css/_theme.scss">click here to see an example)</a>.

			p A helper function is provided to access each map. Please note that some sections are required by mixins, so you muist have them – your SASS won't compile otherwise. Others are optional and depend on your specific needs.
