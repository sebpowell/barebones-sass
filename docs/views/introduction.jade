			p Barebones is a boilerplate to help you build your own <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> framework. It is not a fully-fledged library, but a set of tools common to all projects; a grid system, helper classes and a range of resuable mixins, put together in a convenient package to kickstart your next project. Only the bare essentials are included – so you can spend less time overwriting and more time creating.

			h3 Principles

			h4 Easy to Pick Up
			p Barbones classes are deliberatley verbose to make it super clear to people what each class is doing.

			h4 Made with desig in mind
			p Basscss strikes a balance between consistency and flexibility to allow for rapid prototyping and quick iterative changes when designing in the browser. Easy Designing in the browser should be easy.

			h4 Responsive by Default
			p Basscss provides lightweight, performant styles and flexible utilities to design for any device and to help reduce boilerplate in stylesheets.

			h4 Unassuming
			p Modular and customizable typography and layout styles don’t dictate what things should look like and play well with other stylesheets and frameworks.

			h4 Composable classes
			p Construct anything from complex layouts to responsive components with a series of single purpose classes. Cohesive design system Scale based on the powers of two.

			h4 Responsive
			p Everything should be 100% responsive. Your website should work regardless of a users device or screensize. D

			h4 Unitless

			h4
			p Tachyons isn't a monolithic framework. It's a collection of self contained modules that can be mixed and matched or used independently. Use what you want, leave what you don't. Reusable Doing one thing well, promotes reusability and reduces redundancy in a codebase.

			h2 Why does the world need Barebones?

			p It probably doesn't, but here goes; we wanted to create a lightweight SASS library that we could share between projects – powerful enough to allow us to focus on design, and lightweight enough to stay out of our way.

			p Over time, we've learned a lot about how to structure our SASS projects in a cohesive, scalable and maintainable way. We thought other people might find this knowledge useful so decided to release this as a package in the public domain.

			p Existing frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation are great for prototyping, but typically lack flexibility. If you want to create your own theme, you're going to spend a lot of time with the !important flag – a great way for things to quickly become completely unmanageable.

			p Building your own framework puts you in the driving seat, giving you full control over how your app or website looks, without being shoe-horned into someone else's design system.

			h2 Installing Barebones

			p If you're new to SASS, you'll first need to make sure you're able to <a href="http://sass-lang.com/install" target="_blank">compile SASS files</a>.

			.info-panel.warning
				p In order to use Susy 2 with Rails you must update your Gemfile to use sass-rails ~> 5.0.0. This is because Susy 2 requires Sass >= 3.3 whilst Rails 4.1 and below include a version of sass-rails which does not support Sass 3.3.

			h3 1. Install the package
			p Barebones is available as a Bower package. If you want to copy in the Sass files directly, and skip any package management, you can do that too – simply download the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/sebpowell/barebones-sass">Github</a> and integrate the source files directly.

			.example
				pre.example-code
					code.language-bash
						| bower install barebones-sass --save

			h3 2. Create a settings file

			p Barebones code allows you to specify your own individual project settings – just grab <a href="https://github.com/sebpowell/barebones/blob/master/docs/css/_settings.scss" target="_blank">the example file</a> </strong> and change the values to fit your needs.

			h3 3. Create your main SASS file
			p Import your newly created settings file, followed by <span class="var">_barebones.sass</span> into your main SASS file. When you're done, it should look like this:

			.example.margin-bottom-double
				pre.example-code
					code.language-html.
						|-- css/
						|--| main.sass
						|--| _settings.sass
						|
						|-- bower-components/
						|--| barebones/
						|--|--| dist/
						|--|--|--| _base.sass

			.example
				pre.example-code
					code.language-scss.
						// Always import the settings file first
						@import _settings.scss

						// Import Barebones – the path will depend on your setup.
						@import bower-components/barebones/dist/_base.scss

						// Your stuff can come here.

			h2 Requirements

			p Barebones relies heavily on <a href="">SASS maps</a> to work, so you'll need to make sure you're using SASS 3.3 or higher. Additionally, vendor prefixing mixins are not used or included as you can use the <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer" target="_blank">autoprefixer plugin</a> to do this.

		article.article(id="support")

			h2 Support
			p This library is under active development. If you need help, or if you think something is broken or can be improved, send an email to <a href="mailto:tech@getagent.co.uk">tech@getagent.co.uk</a>.
