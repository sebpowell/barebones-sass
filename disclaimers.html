Investments may have no public market or only a restricted secondary market. Where a secondary market exists, it is not possible to predict the price at which investments will trade in the market or whether such market will be liquid or illiquid. As such investments will not be listed or traded on any exchange, pricing information may be more difficult to obtain and the liquidity of the investments may be adversely affected. A holder may be able to realise value prior to an investment’s maturity date only at a price in an available secondary market.
If you have any questions regarding the document, please contact your ACM Investment Advisor.
