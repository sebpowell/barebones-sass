		article.article
			p Barebones is a boilerplate to help you quickly build your own SASS framework. It is not a fully fledged front-end framework, and simply provides a set of commonly used tools: a customisable grid system, automatically generated helper classes, and a range of mixins. Basic elements, icluding buttons, tables, typographic resets, bullet lists are included with minimal styling so you can spend less time overwriting and more time creating something that looks unique. 

			p The best way to get started with Barebones is to download the <a href="https://github.com/sebpowell/barebones">latest version</a> from Github and start building!

			p You can also get the latest release using Bower, although this is somewhat against the philsophy behind this project (rather than include as a depenency, you should ideally use this as the foundational code).

				code.language-bash
					| bower install barebones

			h2 Requirements

			p Barebones relies heavily on SASS maps to work, so you'll need to make sure you're using SASS 3.3 or higher. Additionally, vendor prefixing mixins are not used or included as you can use the <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer" target="_blank">autoprefixer plugin</a> to do this.
